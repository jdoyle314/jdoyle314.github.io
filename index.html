<h1> Dr. Joseph Doyle  </h1>
<h2> About Me    </h2> 
<p>I was a lecturer at Queen Mary University of London from 2018 to 2023. I was a Postdoctoral Research in Trinity College Dublin from 2012 to 2014, a Senior Research Assoicate at University College London from 2014 to 2016 and a Senior Lecturer at the University of East London from 2016 to 2018. My current research interests are Cloud Computing, Green Computing, Cognitive Resource Management and Containerization. </p>
