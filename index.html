<h1> Dr. Joseph Doyle  </h1>
<h2> About Me    </h2> 
<p>I am a lecturer at Queen Mary University of London. I was a Postdoctoral Research in Trinity College Dublin from 2012 to 2014, a Senior Research Assoicate at University College London from 2014 to 2016 and a Senior Lecturer at the University of East London from 2016 to 2018. My current research interests are Cloud Computing, Green Computing, Cognitive Resource Management and Containerization. </p>
<h2> Projects </h2>
I have been involved in the following projects as part of the startup I co-founded at UCL
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=131983">ACAME: Advanced Control Aspects for Media workload processing</a>
<li> <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=132739">DELVE-VIDEO: Deep-Learning based Bitstream Analytics for Value Discovery in Video</a>
</ul>
